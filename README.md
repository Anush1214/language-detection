# Language Detection Project

## 📌 Overview
This project implements a **Language Detection System** that identifies the language of a given text input. The system uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **machine learning techniques** to accurately predict the language among a predefined set of languages.

## ✅ Features
- Detects the language of input text in real-time.
- Supports multiple languages (e.g., English, French, Spanish, German, etc.).
- Preprocessing steps: tokenization, stopword removal, and feature extraction.
- Machine Learning-based approach for classification.
- Jupyter Notebook implementation for easy experimentation.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Libraries:**
  - `pandas` for data handling
  - `numpy` for numerical operations
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning models
  - `nltk` or `spacy` for NLP tasks (if used)
  - `langdetect` or custom implementation (if applicable)

## 🔍 How It Works
1. **Data Collection:** Uses a multilingual text dataset.
2. **Preprocessing:** Cleans text, removes noise, and converts it into feature vectors (e.g., TF-IDF).
3. **Model Training:** Trains a machine learning classifier (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression).
4. **Prediction:** Given an input text, predicts its language.
5. **Evaluation:** Measures accuracy and performance using test data.

## ▶️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have **Python 3.x** installed and the following packages:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk
```

### Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open `language_detection.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook language_detection.ipynb
   ```
3. Execute the notebook cells step by step.
4. Test the model with custom input text.

## 📊 Results
- Model used: Naive Bayes / Logistic Regression / Other

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add more languages for detection.
- Implement deep learning models for higher accuracy.
- Build a web interface or API for real-time language detection.
